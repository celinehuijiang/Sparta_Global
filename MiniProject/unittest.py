# going to useful when we have situation - something we might want 
# error working properly 
# different method of running that file 
# test fail it is useful  etc
# # pytest- way to check failure in the code 
# give you the nice summary which one past / fail 

# other way it is unit test 
# creating the test using the unit librays 
# work with pytest 
# nice way o break down the test

# using python - m to use unit testing -m - unittest
# onky in here tells you what the error is
# seeing yh output doun here and will show it in the id 

# bunch of testing have different method 

# import new_file - name changes to the actual file

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     unittest.main()

# will throw an error if it is not in the same method
#__name__ - the function of the name 
# run the file sppefically - need to ecute evyerthing 

# import
# from resturant imoport
# will do imports first - favours from local then external srouces 
# external source - don't call by the name 
# funtions and classes- woudn't recommend 
# do things test your varibale?
#help to validate lofic implementation - first of all in the way we want too 
# based on the way we expected to 
# transformation - testing dataframe / various dataframe
# when it comes to testing dataframe - things like thata nd beyind testing logic and functionality 
# always thignk about the function going to return comparisons to what you have expcted
# using the funcion instead 

#implemtn pytest iwhhotu implenting unit test 
# good thing that it doens't require class
# import tables and have a little bit fo setup 

# e.g def add(num1, num2): - new_1

# test returant.py - in another file 
# from new_1 import * 
# def test.add():
# assert_add(2,2) == 4

# run this directly not going to do mcuh 
# same with the unit test it is much easier 
# result of the function somehting that we expected
# take those 2 things out 
# def test.add():
# expected == 4
# actual = add(2,2)
# assert actual == expected

# nice wasy way doing with function - works with variable 
# varibal- not brining anyting in there
# kind of things much more sueful - trying totest soemthing like a dataframe 
# makinng sure it contains the corrrect dataframe 
# somhethin like converting and phone numbers and in the contact columns 
# expected list of phone number
# doingt he function of transformatiom 
# doing bit oft he setup and mocking
# rather then using the dataframe- passed throught the different dataframe
# funtion doing what they supposed to do
# three differetn ways in dooing of numbers - doing four rws of data
# compare to expected and making sure the function
